# nest-git-migration
Test the migration to GitHub of Nest (http://www.nest-initiative.org)

**Serious Warning**

This repository is being used to test the migration of the [Nest simulator](http://www.nest-initiative.org/Software:About_NEST) to GitHub.
Do not, repeat, **DO NOT** fork this repo if you intend to **use** Nest to simulate
spiking neural networks! For that you want the official [Nest](http://www.nest-initiative.org/)
